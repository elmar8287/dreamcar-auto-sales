# Dreamcar Auto Sale - A used cars Diller

## This is an inventory displaying website for USA customers, which is a diller for Mercedes Sprinters and other VANs.

### In this project I used React JS with hooks:
- `useState()`
- `useEffect()`
- `useSelector()`
- `useDispatch()`
- 

## Interesting features implemented:
- Created the contact form by using `useState()` hook to handle all inputs
- Used `useEffect()` hook to monitor any changes in inputs and save in `localStore`
- Used conditional rendering, when the form is submitted (display success message)
- Implemented `Redux` for React
- Used `useSelector()` and `useDispatch()` hooks for working with Redux
